    "Overall problem:\n",
    "The dataset that we have been given has information from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics which has flight performance data for airlines operating in Arizona, Nevada, and California. Our main focus is on flight delays and air traffic patterns. We want to determine which airports have the higheset volume of flights, find peak travel times, and the most common flight routes.\n",
    "1. Understand Air Traffic Patterns:\n",
    "- Analyze flight frequency and distribution across different airports and regions.\n",
    "- Identify the busiest airports and peak travel times.\n",
    "- Look for differences in air traffic based on route, season, and airline.\n",
    "2. Understand Airline Performance that have delays:\n",
    "- Find out which airlines are most prone to delays.\n",
    "- See if certain airports have more delays than others.\n",
    "- Look for trends in departure and arrival delays across different times, days, and months.\n",
    "- Check if there are any factors that lead to flight delays (distance, departure time, weather conditions, number of flights in and out)\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem that we have is about exploratory data analysis as well as inferential analytics to identify trends, relationships, and potential factors that are behind flight delays. The results that we get can give insights to airlines, airport authorities, and passengers to help improve flight operations and help when planning for traveling."
